### Hi there 👋, I'm Matt!
#### Holistic Web Developer • Front-End Development Director
With a long-time passion for computers, I began developing web site in 1995. In 2005, I launched a freelance company, inFLUX Web Design. In 2008, I joined Miva and progressed to become the Product Front-End Development Director.

Skills: I am an old school web developer by trade. I started learning when CSS was "the new thing". Refining my trade over the years, my key focus points are Accessibility, CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and Miva eCommerce.
